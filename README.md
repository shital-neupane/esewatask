# eSewa Hybrid Project

A high-performance hybrid mobile application demonstrating the integration of native Android (Kotlin) and iOS (Swift) with a shared Flutter module. Sensitive logic such as authentication and session management remains native, while complex UI components like product lists and details are shared via Flutter.

## Key Requirements & Implementation

### 1. Native Platform Support
- **Android**: Developed using Kotlin (Target SDK 35).
- **iOS**: Developed using Swift and SwiftUI.
- **Solution**: Native wrappers pre-warm the Flutter engine for near-instant transitions.

### 2. Dynamic Theming
- **Requirement**: Pass theme tokens (Light/Dark mode, Colors, Spacing, Typography) from native to Flutter at runtime.
- **Solution**: The native host builds a configuration JSON and passes it to Flutter during module initialization. Flutter uses Riverpod to manage this global state.

### 3. Session & Security
- **Requirement**: Generate and cache a random UUID upon login; bypass login if cached. Use UUID in all API headers.
- **Solution**:
    - **Android**: Uses `EncryptedSharedPreferences` for secure storage.
    - **iOS**: Uses the system Keychain via a `KeychainHelper`.
    - **Headers**: A Dio interceptor in the Flutter module automatically attaches the `X-Session-UUID` to all network requests.

### 4. Hybrid Navigation
- **Requirement**: seamlessly transition between native views and shared Flutter screens.
- **Solution**: Custom MethodChannels (`com.app.native/flutter`) handle communication, allowing Flutter to trigger native actions like payment processing or logout.

### 5. Shared Product Module
- **Requirement**: Shared UI for product catalogs and details using fakeStoreApi.
- **Solution**: Implemented with Riverpod for state management and Dio for network requests with offline caching capabilities.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd esewa
```

### 2. Prepare Flutter Module
```bash
cd flutter_product_module
flutter clean
flutter pub get
cd ..
```

### 3. Run the Application

#### Android
(Opening with android studio is recommended since it automatically generates config files, if not using android studio you can manually add local.properties file to point to your sdk or set global android home variable)
example local.properties content: sdk.dir=/home/username/Android/Sdk
example android home entry: 
```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=/home/cretor/Android/Sdk
```

```bash
cd esewasub
./gradlew installDebug
```
Open the esewasub app on your device

#### iOS
1. Ensure the Flutter module is prepared (Step 2).
2. Install CocoaPods:
```bash
cd subios/subios
pod install
```
3. Open `subios.xcworkspace` in Xcode.
4. Select a simulator or device and click **Run**.
